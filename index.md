### Welcome!

#### About me

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics and Actuarial-Financial Mathematics at the University of the Aegean. 


#### Previous positions

From May 2020 until January 2024, I was postdoctoral researcher at Aalto university working in [Prof. Simo Särkkä's](https://users.aalto.fi/~ssarkka/) group. Previous to this I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg MD, USA) working with [Dr. Antonio Possolo](https://www.nist.gov/people/antonio-possolo).  Before joining NIST, I was doing my PhD (thesis title: Bayesian nonparametrics and Applications)
in the Department of Mathematics, [Division of Statistics](http://www.actuar.aegean.gr/index.php/en/) at University of the Aegean, Greece under the supervision of [Prof. Spyros Hatjispyros](http://www.samos.aegean.gr/actuar/schatz/index.htm).

Further back in time, I received a MSc in Statistics from the same department 
and I studied Mathematics at the University of Patras, Greece with a specialization on
Computational Mathematics and Informatics.

#### Research interests

My [research interests](https://cmerkatas.github.io/research/) lie in Bayesian nonparametrics, Applied Stochastic Differential Equations, MCMC algorithms and stochastic dynamic systems.

#### Teaching

I am teaching the following two courses in the spring semester (2024):
1. Introduction to Bayesian statistics
2. Nonparametric statistics
