### Welcome to my webpage!

#### About me
In July 2018 I've joined the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg MD, USA) as a postdoc research in the Statistical Engineering Division.  My old [website](http://actuarweb.aegean.gr/phd/cmerkatas/) in the [department of Statistics](http://www.actuar.aegean.gr) is old and outdated.

Previous to this, I did my PhD (thesis title: Bayesian nonparametrics and Applications)
in the Department of Mathematics at University of the Aegean, Greece under the supervision of [Spyros Hatjispyros](http://www.samos.aegean.gr/actuar/schatz/index.htm).

Further back in time, I received a MSc in Statistics from the same department 
and I studied Mathematics at the University of Patras, Greece with a specialization on
Computational Mathematics and Informatics.

My research interests lie in Bayesian nonparametrics and MCMC algorithms.
